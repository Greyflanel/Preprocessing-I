            Web development has given me a career, but it has also provided me
            with a passion. I was never aware of how much I enjoyed solving
            problems on a computer, until I experienced it firsthand. It is a
            particular pleasure for me. Therefore, I can confidently claim, that
            I bring a distinct ability to the table. The ability to attack a
            problem from all sides, with a ferocious curiosity, that ultimately
            arrives at a proper solution.
